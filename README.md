<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Content 
* Sequences and series
* Trigonometry
* Vector calculus
* Geometries in 3-space
* Derivation
* Integration
* Differential equations
* GeoGebra (independent document)
### Built With

* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)
* [TeX Studio](https://www.texstudio.org/)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This space includes the complete file structure of the book ready to be compiled in a TeX-editor. The main documents are

- bokR2_pdf.tex (builds the PDF of the main book)
- bokR2.tex (builds the PDF of the main book, adapted for two-sided printing)
- ggbr2.tex (builds the PDF of the book on GeoGebra 5) 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
My personal target is to make a collection of (free) books covering the topics up to pre-calculus level. Upcoming changes for this book includes 
- adding content covering numerical methods 
- adapting the book to the new guidelines set by Utdanningsdirektoratet, invoked on 01.08.2022  

In addition, any feedback on the books content is always welcome.
